# Lookup table for the default region of interest in eV for fluorescence light given out by a particular atomic edges.
# This information is used to setup the detector
# Lines starting with a # are treated as comments and ignored
# Each line gives the region of interest for a particular edge. 
#
# Each line starts with a name of the form 'Element'_'Edge'
# e.g. The K edge for Vanadium is identified by the name V_K
# e.g. The L2 edge for Astatine is identified by the name At_L2
#
# After the name of the  edge is the low and high value for the region of interest for the detector. The number can be commana, space or tab separated.
