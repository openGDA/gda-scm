README for BSSC remoting
======================== 

A very simple way to integrate the sample changer is by using a proxy to the server interface over our own protocol (Exporter). To do so: 

1-    Enable the Exporter server in the config window (keep port=9555)
2-    Test the server launching our generic client  (correct the path to put JLib in the classpath): 
        java -cp ../../BSSC/lib/JLib.jar org.embl.net.ExporterClientFrame tcp://localhost:9555
3-    If the generic client works you can compile and execute the attached client example with something like:
        javac.exe -cp .;../../BSSC/lib/JLib.jar;../../BSSC/BSSC.jar BSSCClient.java
        java.exe -cp ../../BSSC/lib/JLib.jar;../../BSSC/BSSC.jar;. BSSCClient

BSSCClient.java creates  a client to the Sample Changer and then a Proxy to scServerInterface. This is the actual server interface, which is defined in BSSC.jar (I attach it to illustrate).    

If you want to go in this direction I can give you more details. Epics is not a good interface for this kind of application. We can have the same kind of proxies also over RMI but this hasnâ€™t been tested.
